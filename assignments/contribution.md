# Contribution to an Open Source Software Project

**GROUP ASSIGNMENT**

**Deadline**: MULTIPLE

**Value**: Multi-part (Total: 55%)

You are requested to make a significant contribution to an Open Source Software project. You will need to interact with the community and the existing code base. You MUST make a code contribution. You may start with a small contribution on documentation or translation to learn the process (although, this is not required).

The first step towards that end is choosing a project. There are a couple of them that I anticipate that can accomodate some of you:

* [Jabref ](http://www.github.com/Jabref/Jabref) - Citation Manager. Mainly developed in Java. JabRef people are enthusiastic about applying MVVM to their project. It is a good learning experience, and will certainly help the community. Use the wiki as a starting point for development. In addition there is an example on the JavaFX stuff regarding the MVVM pattern. Here [https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/wiki/Code---JavaFX]. The community is aware that you are working on this course.
* [KDE Cantor](https://edu.kde.org/cantor/) - Music Education project. Mainly developed in C++ and Qt/QML. Filipe Saraiva is a maintainer and is aware that you are working on this
* [FluxPuppy](https://github.com/bnasr/FluxPuppy) - NAU developed Android (Java) software to work with Licor 820 and 840 CO2 measurement devices. The software will be of great interests to the ecology community. --> [Tasks and details available here](assignments/FluxPuppy.md)
* [phenoRemote](https://github.com/katharynduffy/phenoRemote) - An Open Shiny(R) interface project that integrates Phenocam & remotely sensed data products (developer at NAU) 
* [qiime2](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2) - extensible, and decentralized microbiome analysis package with a focus on data and analysis transparency. Developed in Python
* [DeepState](https://github.com/trailofbits/deepstate) - has multiple help wanted issues, some of which might be quite suitable for an advanced undergrad.  It's a test generation tool for C and C++, GoogleTest that allows automatic test generation, basically.  Bringing security vulnerability detection tools into the unit testing/early dev cycle is the big idea.. Prof. Alex Groce is one of the main devs, so he can provide more info/help if students are interested.
* [R packages](https://github.com/tdhock/oss-class-ideas) - Professor Toby Hocking has a lot of interesting ideas and projects that need some support. Please check his ideas page and see if you are interested in some of them.

At the end of the term, it is expected that you have one or more contributions submitted, peer-evaluated (in classroom), reviewed by project members, and accepted. Here are overall steps and dates (more details to come).

**EVERYTHING PRODUCED DURING THE COURSE NEED TO BE PEER-REVIEWED BY ANOTHER GROUP BEFORE THE FINAL SUBMISSION**

| Step                                                        | Expected deliverable                                         | Due on  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| Checkpoint 0                                                | **Stand up presentation (5-7 minutes)**<br>Decision about project and plan on steps towards contribution | Oct. 9  |
| Checkpoint 1                                                | **Presentation<br>**\* Present the task(s) details + progress report<br>* First impressions/guidelines availability<br>* Architectural analysis of the software (document) | Oct. 25 |
| Checkpoint 2                                                | **Group+instructor presentation**<br>Progress report         | Nov. 15 |
| Code submitted for in-class review                          | Code produced during the period (to be reviewed by another group) -- This is not a formal deadline since this process will happen throughout the term, whenever a review is needed (you should not expect anything after Nov 22) | Nov. 22 |
| Final submission (tentative)                                | Start to care about submitting your last patches to the project | Nov. 29 |
| Checkpoint 4                                                | Final presentation (group + instructor)<br>*can be done during office hours* | Dec. 6  |
| Contribution to Open Source ([Final report](#Final-Report)) | Summary of the contribution process (I recommend to be written on-the-fly to avoid forgetting things) | Dec. 13 |

*IN CASE THE PROJECT IS HOSTED IN GITHUB*: The group will need to curate a fork of the project in which they will work. All commits need to become a Pull-request in this fork to train the students on the git use and also in the GitHub use. To do so, it is recommended that you create a central fork, and each student in the group create a "sub-fork". Whenever there is a pull request ready for reviewing, the instructor (me) will assign another group to proceed with the peer review (giving them a specific deadline to do so -- be prepared to do it within the week). After receiving the OK from the peer-reviewing group, you can go ahead and create a pull request against the other project.



*IN CASE THE PROJECT IS HOSTED **OUTSIDE** GITHUB*: The group will need to curate a clone of the project in which they will work.  Whenever there is a patch ready for reviewing, the instructor (me) will assign another group to proceed with the peer review (giving them a specific deadline to do so -- be prepared to do it within the week). After receiving the OK from the peer-reviewing group, you can go ahead and submit it the way the project wants it.



### Final Report

Each group will write up a document describing the contribution process of an existing large open source project, based on investigating the publicly available information about this project. This is the final deliverable of the project and can contain problems faced during the process, how did you apply your knowledge,a nd what kind of new skills the group acquired during this journey. It needs to present and overview of the project and the task, followed by the details of your contribution process.
